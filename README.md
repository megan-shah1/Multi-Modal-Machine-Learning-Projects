# Multi Modal Machine Learning Projects
This repository showcases three machine learning projects all of which involve harnessing the power of machine learning
to analyze sensory, visual and audio data. 

## Machine_LearningData_Analysis Project
- The first project titled "Machine_LearningDataAnalysis" involves using the Pandas Dataframe to take large sums of article
and author data and develop dataframes and graphs based on analyisis. Using the power of Pandas, we are able to break down author publications by year and area to generate graphs about the occurrences of publications across the world.
